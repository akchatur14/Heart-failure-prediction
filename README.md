# Cardiovascular Health Analysis

## Overview

This research project aims to comprehensively analyze the factors responsible for cardiac arrest, encompassing nutrition intake, dietary habits, liver health, physical activity, and muscle strain. The study will also investigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the incidence of cardiac arrest in two diverse countries, India and the USA. Machine learning models will be employed to predict the causes of frequent heart attacks based on these multifactorial variables.

## Research Question

Can machine learning models effectively predict the causes of frequent heart attacks based on a combination of nutrition intake, dietary habits, liver health, physical activity, and muscle strain?

## Dataset

The dataset for this project consists of three parts:

1. **Nutrient Intake Data:**

## Motivation

I am working on this project because of my keen interest in healthcare. The healthcare industry offers vast opportunities for data analysis, and I believe implementing a predictive model in this context is both challenging and impactful. This project also serves as a means to enhance my skills as a machine learning engineer, providing me with hands-on experience in multifactorial analysis and further developing my analytical skills.
